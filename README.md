Welcome to Azure Kickstarter Hackathon. The purpose of this workshop is to give you hands-on experience on Azure and ensure you'll get a solid understanding of foundational concepts. But don't worry, we are not going to bore you with theoretical lectures. You will be given practical challenges to complete on your own. There are standard challenges which you have to complete to advance to the next one, and there are bonus exercises if you decide to go above and beyond. 

### Hints
Every challenge comes with a dedicated page of hints to help you overcome the challenge. Try to not read the hints at first and use your own creativity and knowledge to complete the exercises. There may be multiple ways to do the same exercise, and whichever way you choose is completely Ok, as long as you achieve the desired results.

### Group work
You will be working with a peer to complete this workshop. While working together, it is important that each of you completes the practical challenges on his/her own. e.g. deploy VMs, create storage accounts, etc. In the end, each person has their own environment and output.

## Scenario
You are a cloud architect working at Contoso. Contoso is an insurance company with a global presence. Their headquarter is based in Munich, Germany. The IT department is in the middle of a decision making process to migrate part of their on-premise critical infrastructure to Azure. Before any decision is made, they are running a PoC to set up a resilient infrastructure on Azure. This includes implementing several services, including web servers, application servers, file services, backup, and disaster recovery. The team at Contoso wants to test resiliency against zonal as well as regional failure and to ensure the systems are still able to operate within a defined time range. The success of this test is important in their decision to move their own critical business systems to Azure.

You are responsible for orchestrating and implementing this PoC from end to end. Together with the team you have decided to split the whole test into separate stages:

- Challenge 1 - Implement public facing web servers in a highly-available setup
- Challenge 2 - Set up an application server
- Challenge 3 - Set up and configure file storage
- Challenge 4 - Configure backup for your files and servers
- Challenge 5 - Enable disaster recovery for your servers and storage
- Challenge 6 - Expand your web servers' presence to more regions and increase their availability
