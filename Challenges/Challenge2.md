## Challenge 2
In this challenge you are asked to use Azure Files to provide file storage and sharing. You will then set up a VM acting as an application server to connect to Azure Files.

### Success Requirements
- Feel free to use any tiers on Azure Files. 
- Make sure your Azure Files shares are geo-replicated. 
- Upload any sample data to your file share.
- Perform a manual snapshot on your file share to ensure you have a backup after you copy your data. (You don't need to perform regular backups at this stage).
- Set up a Virtual Machine and connect your Azure Files share to it over a private network. You can use any Operating System for your VM, but Windows will probably make your life easier.
- Using the Virtual Machine, make sure you can copy files to and from the file share.
