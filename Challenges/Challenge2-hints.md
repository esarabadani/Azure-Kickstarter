## Challenge 2 Hints
- To use Azure Files, you will need to create a Storage Account on Azure. See the [tutorial here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share?tabs=azure-portal).
- To connect to your Azure Files share over a private network, you will need a Private Endpoint. See the [tutorial here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-networking-endpoints?tabs=azure-portal).
- You can use the same Virtual Network in Challenge 1, but make sure you create and use a new subnet in it for this exercise.
